That way we can also integrate the balance objective without getting lower div prereqs for electives in the final terms (something that happens becuase the elective as such doesn't have the lower div as a prereq but it MIGHT.)

- [ ] Apparently in 2024 MC33 FI and RE are infeasible period. Look into that
